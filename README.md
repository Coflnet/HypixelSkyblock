# HypixelSkyblock
This is the back-end for https://sky.coflnet.com 
You can get the same data and play around with it by using this project.

Some endpoins are exposed via REST, see the open-api docs: https://sky.coflnet.com/api

# Requests
### General
> **Deprecatation WARNING** The command endpoints are getting deprecated please use the REST-endpoints (/api)

The backend uses a concept called `commands`.
All commands are based on the format `type` `data` as `JSON` or `MessagePack`. The content of `data` depends on the `type` and usually is another escaped and `base64` encoded `json` object.
Example:
```
{
    "type":"auctionDetails",
    "data":"2194c8c742b0452d9a3ecd3bd1835013"
}
```
You can find a bare bone example frontend inside the file `test_frontend.html`.
It has no UI and you have to interact with it via the console and the `sendData` comand.
1. Copy the script 
2. make sure you use the hosted backend if you are not running it locally
3. Open the file in chrome
3. Open the brwoser console
4. Try `sendData("filterFor","ASPECT_OF_THE_END")`
